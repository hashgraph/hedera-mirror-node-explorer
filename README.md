### Run the Explorer with a local mirror node
The Explorer can be used with a local mirror by means of a .env file located at the root 
of the repository and containing the definition of the following variables to add a custom menu
item in the network selector pull-down menu:

- VUE_APP_LOCAL_MIRROR_NODE_URL=\<URL of the local mirror node\>
- VUE_APP_LOCAL_MIRROR_NODE_MENU_NAME=\<label of the custom menu item\>

The latter may be omitted and will default to 'LOCALNET'

### Run the Explorer locally in Docker
```
npm run build:docker
docker compose up
```

### Customize configuration

###### Branding

The Hedera Mirror Node Explorer UI can be customized by adding a branding 
directory which path can be provided by the environment variable *$BRANDING_LOCATION*.
If this variable is not defined a directory *./branding* will be looked for
at the root of the repository.
This directory should have the following structure:

```
./assets/brand-product-logo.png
./assets/brand-sponsor-logo.png
./assets/brand-theme.scss
./public/*
```
- The file *brand-product-logo.png* should be a 660x181 PNG file, which, if present, will be
  taken into account by the build and put in the top-left placeholder of the Explorer NavBar.
- The file *brand-sponsor-logo.png* should be a 744x313 PNG file, which, if present, will be
  taken into account by the build and put in the bottom-right placeholder of the Explorer footer.
- The file *brand-theme.scss* may provide a modified version of the file located under
  *./src/assets/styles/brand-theme.scss* and, if present, will supersede it.
- Any file present in the *./public/* directory will be added to the content of the 
  *./public* directory, which allows to customize the favicon.

###### Vue CLI

The Hedera Mirror Node Explorer is based on the Vue CLI framework.
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) for Vue CLI related aspects.
