# hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node-explorer

Visual Explorer for the Hedera Hashgraph DLT.

## Project setup

```shell
npm install
```

## Build

### Compile and hot-reload for development

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Compile and minify for production

```shell
npm run build
```

### Lint files (find and fix problems)

```shell
npm run lint
```

## Test

### Run unit tests (based on Jest)

```shell
npm run test:unit
```

### Run end-to-end tests (based on Cypress)

```shell
# Run the tests interactively
npm run test:e2e:dev 
# Or run the tests in headless browser mode
npm run test:e2e
```

## Run local sourcify instance (for smart contract verification)

This set-up uses an nginx reverse proxy in front of the 3 sourcify services (ui, server, repository) in order to 
support HTTPS. The SSL set-up is based on a self-signed certificate obtained per the instructions at:
https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/

The design of the repository (itself based on an nginx reverse proxy) is such that it requires to be on a distinct host, 
so it cannot be accessed by localhost like ui and server. To this effect you need to define a hostname locally (see below)

```shell
# Define the domain repository.local` used by the repository
bash -c 'echo "127.0.0.1       repository.local" >> /etc/hosts'

# Start sourcify services
# in sourcify-setup directory do:
docker-compose up -d

# Invoke the server API once to make sure your browser accepts the self-signed certificate
open https://localhost/server/chains

# To open the sourcify UI
open https://localhost

# To open the sourcify repository UI
open https://repository.local

# Stop sourcify services
# in sourcify-setup directory do:
docker-compose down
```

## Run in Docker

```shell
# Build the Docker image locally
npm run docker:build

# Copy and adjust configuration of Hedera networks as needed
cp networks-config-example.json networks-config.json

# Start the Docker container
# (if not built locally, this will fetch a pre-built image from Google Container Registry)
npm run docker:start
open http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Stop the Docker container
npm run docker:stop

# then open http://localhost:8080 in your web browser
```

## Run in Kubernetes

To run in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) the hedera-explorer [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart can be used. First,
obtain access to a Kubernetes cluster running version 1.23 or greater. [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
can be used for a local Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
helm upgrade --install hedera-explorer chart/
```

### Configure custom networks (can also be used for development)

By default the hedera explorer has support for MAINNET, PREVIEWNET and TESTNET. If you want to add or remove more networks
you can specify it using the `customNetworkConfig` in the `values.yaml` file

An example:
```
 config: |
  [
    {
      "name": "mainnet",
      "displayName": "MAINNET",
      "url": "https://mainnet-public.mirrornode.hedera.com/",
      "ledgerID": "00"
    },
    {
      "name": "testnet",
      "displayName": "TESTNET",
      "url": "https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/",
      "ledgerID": "01"
    },
    {
      "name": "previewnet",
      "displayName": "PREVIEWNET",
      "url": "https://previewnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/",
      "ledgerID": "02"
    },
    {
      "name": "local",
      "displayName": "LOCALNET",
      "url": "/",
      "ledgerID": "03"
    }
  ]
```

## Configuration

### Customize the available networks

The list of networks available in the network selector (top navigation bar)
can be configured in the file `/public/networks-config.json`.
This JSON file contains an array of entries with the following syntax:

```shell
[
  ...
  {
    "name": "mainnet",
    "displayName": "MAINNET",
    "url": "https://mainnet-public.mirrornode.hedera.com/",
    "ledgerID": "00"
  },
  ...
]
```

This file initially contains the configuration allowing to connect to the
_mainnet/testnet/previewnet_ networks. This configuration may be augmented, altered or
replaced as needed.
Note:
- When this file is missing, is empty, or does not have the expected syntax, 
  the configuration falls back to _mainnet/testnet/previewnet_.
- The `name` of the network has to be unique
- The `displayName` is the string inserted in the network selector. 
  It will default to the network `name` in uppercase. A `displayName`
  exceeding 15 characters will be truncated.
- The `ledgerID` is required to process the ID checksums shown in the UI.
- The maximum number of networks taken into account is 15. The rest will be ignored.

### Customize the UI

A few aspects of the Explorer UI, such as the product name displayed at the bottom of the pages,
are controlled by environment variables defined in the `.env` file. These will be taken into 
account at build time. 

#### Enabling the Staking page

The Staking page allows the user to connect a wallet to the Explorer and to choose to stake her account balance
to a selected network node or to another account.

By default, the Staking page is disabled, and the corresponding menu item is absent from the top navigation bar.
To enable the Staking page and menu item, set the following variable to *true* in the .env file:

```shell
VITE_APP_ENABLE_STAKING=true
```

### Customize the look and feel

#### Branding

In addition to the configuration variables described above,
the Hedera Mirror Node Explorer UI can be customized by adding a branding
directory which path can be provided by the environment variable *$BRANDING_LOCATION*.
If this variable is not defined a directory *./branding* will be looked for
at the root of the repository.
This directory should have the following structure:

```shell
./assets/brand-product-logo.png
./assets/brand-sponsor-logo.png
./assets/brand-theme.scss
./public/*
```

- The file `brand-product-logo.png` should be a 660x181 PNG file, which, if present, will be
  taken into account by the build and put in the top-left placeholder of the Explorer NavBar.
- The file `brand-sponsor-logo.png` should be a 744x313 PNG file, which, if present, will be
  taken into account by the build and put in the bottom-right placeholder of the Explorer footer.
- The file `brand-theme.scss` may provide a modified version of the file located under
  `./src/assets/styles/brand-theme.scss` and, if present, will supersede it.
- Any file present in the `./public/` directory will be added to the content of the 
  `dist/` directory, which allows to customize the favicon.
