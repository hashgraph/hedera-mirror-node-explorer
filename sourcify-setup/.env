### USE THIS TO DEPLOY UI, SERVER & REPOSITORY RUNNING AS DOCKER CONTAINERS
###

# Server config
## Path where verified contracts will be saved
## WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE. It is currently used both as mount point
## and as the path inside server container
REPOSITORY_PATH=../../data/repository
## Path where Solidity compiler binaries will be saved (inside container)
SOLC_REPO=/home/data/solc-bin/linux-amd64
## Path where Solidity JS (solc-js) compilers will be saved (inside container)
SOLJSON_REPO=/home/data/solc-bin/soljson
## Server port inside the docker container
SERVER_PORT=80
## The fully qualified domain name of the host running the ui
## used by Server to configure allowed origins for CORS
UI_DOMAIN_NAME=localhost
## Feature flag for Create2 verification endpoints
SERVER_CREATE2_VERIFICATION=false

## Note:
##  - the 'ui' and 'repository' services no longer use the following environment variables
##    but instead read their runtime config from their config.json file. This can be a mount point
##    provided to the docker container (see environments/docker-compose-hedera.yaml for example)
##    and defaults to the file statically included at build time (resp. ui/public/config.json and
##    h5ai-nginx/select-contract-form/public/config.json)
##  - the 'server' uses the REPOSITORY_SERVER_URL env variable to return links to the various
##    contract files.
REPOSITORY_SERVER_URL=https://repository.local
